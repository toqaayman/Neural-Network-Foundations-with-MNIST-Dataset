# Neural Network Foundations with MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This project involves the foundational training of neural networks using the MNIST dataset, a classic in the field of machine learning for handwritten digit recognition. The focus is on building and understanding the structure and function of various neural network architectures.

## Data Description
The MNIST dataset comprises 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), split into training and testing sets. Each image is grayscale and has a dimension of 28x28 pixels.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Model Architecture
The models include:
- A dense neural network with a single hidden layer.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers.

## Setup and Installation
Ensure you have Python and the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras
```
## Usage
1. Load the MNIST data.
2. Preprocess the data by normalizing and reshaping as required for the model.
3. Train the models and evaluate their performance on the test set.
## Model Training and Evaluation
The project includes training various models and evaluating their performance using accuracy metrics. Specific attention is given to tweaking model parameters to optimize performance.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the models or experiment with different architectures are welcome. Please ensure to provide detailed descriptions of your modifications.
